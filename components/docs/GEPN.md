# Genesis Exchange Partner Network (GEPN)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Genesis Exchange Partner Network (GEPN) is a strategic ecosystem designed to integrate third-party services directly into the Genesis Exchange platform. It transforms the "Outside Google" action items from simple external links into a deeply integrated, value-driven workflow. Instead of sending our users out to partners, we bring the partners' core value *in* to our users, right at their moment of need. This creates a seamless experience for founders, a clear ROI for partners, and a powerful, multi-faceted revenue engine for the Genesis Exchange.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Founder-First Experience:** Integrations must be natural, reduce friction, and be genuinely helpful for improving a founder's Genesis Score.
- **Value-Driven Integration:** We only partner with services that provide clear, measurable value within the Genesis workflow.
- **Data Privacy & Consent:** The founder is always in control. All data sharing is based on explicit, user-driven consent via industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0.
- **Transparency:** All sponsored or paid partnerships are clearly and unambiguously disclosed to the user.

## 3. Tiers of Integration

The GEPN is built on a three-tiered architecture, allowing partners to choose their level of integration and investment.

### Tier 1: Promoted Partner (Sponsored Link)

This is the entry-level partnership, offering enhanced visibility.

- **How it Works:** Partners pay a subscription fee for a "Promoted" or "Sponsored" slot within the "Outside Google" list for relevant action items. This slot features their logo, a more prominent description, and a special offer for Genesis users.
- **Technical Lift:** Low. Requires only database entries to flag a partner as sponsored.
- **Monetization:** A simple, recurring SaaS fee for premium placement (e.g., **Bronze Tier Partnership**).

### Tier 2: Embedded Experience (MCP)

This tier keeps the user within the Genesis ecosystem, providing a more seamless workflow.

- **How it Works:** Clicking a Tier 2 partner link opens a modal within our application containing a secure, sandboxed `<iframe>` of the partner's service. The user can perform core actions (e.g., create a project, sign a document) without leaving Genesis.
- **Technical Lift:** Medium. The partner must provide a lightweight, embeddable version of their application. Genesis implements secure sandboxing and can pass contextual data to the embedded app.
- **Monetization:** A higher recurring SaaS fee for the deeper integration and user engagement (**Silver Tier Partnership**). Potential for pay-per-action (PPA) fees.

### Tier 3: Deep API Integration (Full Workflow Partner)

This is the highest level of partnership, enabling true, bidirectional workflows and making the partner a core part of the Genesis experience.

- **How it Works:** Involves direct, server-to-server API communication authorized by the user via OAuth 2.0. For example, a founder can connect their Indeed account, pull a list of applicants for a job, and run an eGUMP score on them, all within the Genesis platform.
- **Technical Lift:** High. Requires the development of a public-facing Genesis Partner API, a developer portal, standardized data schemas, and webhook infrastructure for real-time updates.
- **Monetization:** A significant platform subscription fee (**Gold Tier Partnership**), combined with powerful usage-based monetization models:
  - **Pay-per-eGUMP Score:** Charge partners a micro-transaction each time a founder uses our AI to score a candidate from their platform.
  - **Success-Based Revenue Share:** Negotiate a percentage of the placement fee when a founder hires a candidate sourced and vetted through a GEPN partner integration.

## 4. Financial & Monetization Strategy

The GEPN creates a robust, multi-faceted revenue model:

1.  **SaaS Subscriptions:** Tiered monthly/annual fees for partners to access different levels of integration (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
2.  **Usage-Based Fees (PPA):** Micro-transactions for high-value API calls, such as running an eGUMP score.
3.  **Revenue Sharing:** Aligning our success with our partners' success by taking a percentage of downstream revenue generated through the platform (e.g., hiring placement fees, legal document filing fees).
4.  **Targeted Sponsorships:** Premium fees for "Promoted" placements, offering partners highly targeted visibility at the exact moment a founder has a declared need.
