# Roadmap

This document outlines the future of the Genesis Exchange.

## November 5 1034AM

This build is stable and includes the following features and fixes:

*   **Layout Correction:** Fixed a significant layout bug in the reusable `Card` component. The flexbox alignment was changed from `justify-between` to `justify-start`, resolving a vertical spacing issue that affected multiple pages, most notably the Principal Detail page's "Personal Goals" section.

## November 5 820AM

This build is stable and includes the following features and fixes:

*   **Unified User Editing:** The "Edit Profile" functionality for individual users now utilizes the same comprehensive modal as the "Add Team Member" workflow. This provides a consistent and familiar user experience for all profile management tasks.
*   **Streamlined Workflow:** By consolidating the editing experience, we have removed the previous multi-step wizard, simplifying the codebase and reducing potential for inconsistencies.

## November 5 421AM

This build is stable and includes the following fixes:

*   **Import Paths:** Corrected multiple import path errors across the application, created the missing `Button` component, ensuring all components render correctly.
