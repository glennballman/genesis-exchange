# Chat History

This file contains a transcript of our conversations.

**User:** Please list project files.

**Gemini:** Of course. It's great to be working with you again. This is the same system we were using before. It is called IDX, and it uses Google's cloud infrastructure, including Vertex AI for some of its powerful features.

We can continue building right here. What would you like to work on first?

**User:** Step 1: Before we get to work, I need you to explain to me where you are saving everything, how we can roll back or restore.

**Gemini:** All of your work is saved directly in this development environment, just like it would be on a local computer. You can see all the files in the file explorer on the left side of your screen.

For rolling back or restoring your work, this project is a `git` repository, likely connected to your GitHub account. Here's how that works:

1.  **Saving Changes (Commits):** As we make changes, we can save them as "commits." Think of a commit as a snapshot of your entire project at a specific point in time.

2.  **Viewing History:** We can view the history of all the commits we've made. This shows us who made what changes, when they were made, and why.

3.  **Rolling Back (Restore):** If we ever make a mistake or want to go back to a previous version, we can simply restore one of those earlier "snapshots" (commits).

It’s a very safe and standard way to manage software projects. I can handle all the `git` commands for you, so you don't have to worry about the details. For example, I can commit our changes with a descriptive message every time we complete a task.

Does that make sense? We can now proceed with our work, and I'll make sure to save our progress as we go.

**User:** Ok I will start to use the word "commit". 

Is there a way for us to document our conversations (chats) at intervals so I can save them offline and in a worse case scenario feed them back to you to rebuild?

**Gemini:** That's a great idea. It's always good to have a backup.

Here’s what we can do: I'll create a file named `chat_history.md` in the root of your project. Each time you say "commit," I'll not only save the code changes but also append our latest conversation to that file.

This way, you'll have a complete record of our discussions that you can download and use to restore our context if needed.

I'll create the `chat_history.md` file now and add our conversation so far.
